# 4 Way Traffic Signal System

## Overview
This project showcases a practical application of traffic signals in modern-day scenarios. Using logic gates and a timer circuit, the system efficiently manages traffic lights at intersections. It's important to note that this serves as a basic representation with simple circuitry and differs from real-time traffic control systems.

## Components
- Diode – IN4007
- 555 Timer IC
- CMOS – 4017
- NOT gate – IC74LS04
- AND gate – IC74LS08
- Capacitor
- Resistor
- Traffic lights

## Working
### Initialization
All lights are initially set to red.

### Phases
- **Green Phase:** Each direction's green light is activated based on conditions, often determined by logic gates.
- **Yellow Phase:** A brief warning yellow light precedes the red phase.
- **Red Phase:** The green light turns off, and the red light is displayed for a specific direction while others may receive the green signal.

## Additional Features
The system includes pedestrian signals and left-turn indicators. Advanced systems use sensors for real-time traffic adaptation. Controllers can cycle through phases and offer manual control for special situations or emergencies.

## Applications
- Intersection Control
- Pedestrian Safety
- Left Turn Movements
- Flashing Mode
- Emergency Vehicle Preemption
- School Zones
- Railroad Crossings
- Roundabouts

## Conclusion
In conclusion, 4-way traffic signals are integral to urban and suburban landscapes, managing vehicles and pedestrians with engineering precision and safety innovation. They signify our commitment to safer roads, orderly intersections, and reduced congestion.
