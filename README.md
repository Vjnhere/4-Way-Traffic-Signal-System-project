# 4 Way Traffic Signal System

## Overview
This project showcases a practical application of traffic signals in modern-day scenarios. Using logic gates and a timer circuit, the system efficiently manages traffic lights at intersections. It's important to note that this serves as a basic representation with simple circuitry and differs from real-time traffic control systems.

## Components
- Diode – IN4007
- 555 Timer IC
- CMOS – 4017
- NOT gate – IC74LS04
- AND gate – IC74LS08
- Capacitor
- Resistor
- Traffic lights

## Working
### Initialization
All lights are initially set to red.

### Phases
- **Green Phase:** Each direction's green light is activated based on conditions, often determined by logic gates.
- **Yellow Phase:** A brief warning yellow light precedes the red phase.
- **Red Phase:** The green light turns off, and the red light is displayed for a specific direction while others may receive the green signal.
